<h1>Deep Learning Apprach for Polyp Detection</h1>
<p>In this project, YOLOv8 is trained using multiple datasets from the Harvard Dataverse containing polyps and 
  XML annotations such as the MICCAI 2017, CVC Colon DB, GLRC, KUMC, and University of Kansas Medical Center. 
  To further improve the accuracy and performance, the YOLOv8 network is modified with Depthwise Separable Convolutions (DSConv) and Feature Enhancement Modules
 (FEM). The trained model will then be evaluated based of the precision, recall rate, and mAP (mean average precision) and will be compared with other trained Deep Learning models.</p>
